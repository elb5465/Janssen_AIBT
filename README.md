# Janssen AIBT Operations Manual

**Janssen AIBT** is the Bluetooth Android app for Janssen's one-press patient-controlled injectors. This is meant to be used in conjunction with a Raspberry Pi 'Zero W', which is running the Python scripts located in the repository: https://github.com/elb5465/Janssen_AIBT. There, you will also find this manual and the Android app download (the '.apk' file). Alternatively, these files can be downloaded and saved remotely in another storage provider like Google Drive or Box.

## How to Use

1. **Turn on the Raspberry Pi:**  Connect the Raspberry Pi via micro-USB to a  power supply of around *5V* (Most portable battery packs are suitable for this).
2. On the Android phone, go to settings and select Bluetooth settings
3. Start the Android app
4. **To turn off the Raspberry Pi:** Find the attached button, and hold it down for 3 seconds. *You will see the green light on the Raspberry Pi begin to blink about 10 times and then disappear. At that point unplug the power supply from the Raspberry Pi.*
